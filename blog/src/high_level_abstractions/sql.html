    <h2>How to use the SQL JOIN?</h2>

    <p>Let's create two tables to check how the SQL JOIN works <br>
    but first we have to create the database(schema) that we are going to use for testing.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
       CREATE DATABASE restaurante;
       use restaurante; 
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code>
        DROP TABLE IF exists customers;
        CREATE TABLE customers(
            customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
            customer_name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
            contact_name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
            country VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL
        )ENGINE = InnoDB
        DEFAULT CHARACTER SET = utf8mb4;

        DROP TABLE IF EXISTS orders;
        CREATE TABLE orders(
            order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
            customer_id INT NOT NULL,
            date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)   
        )ENGINE = InnoDB
        DEFAULT CHARACTER SET = utf8mb4;


    </code></pre>

    <p>
        So now that we have created our tables, let's insert some data.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>
        INSERT INTO customers(customer_name, contact_name, country) VALUES 
        ('Alfreds Futterkiste', 'Maria Anders',  'Germany'),
        ('Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados', 'Ana Trujillo', 'Mexico'),
        ('Antonio Moreno Taqueria', 'Antonio Moreno', 'Mexico');

        INSERT INTO orders(customer_id) VALUES
        (2);
    </code></pre>

    <p>Before we use the JOIN statement, let me clarify a point, there are many types <br>
    of JOINS, these are the different JOIN types that we can use:

    </p>

    <ul>
    <li><code>(INNER) JOIN</code>: Returns records that have matching values in both tables</li>
    <li><code>LEFT (OUTER) JOIN</code>: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table</li>
    <li><code>RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN</code>: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched 
    records from the left table</li>
    <li><code>FULL (OUTER) JOIN</code>: Returns all records when there is a match in either left 
    or right table</li>

</ul>

    <p>For this first example we are going to use the '(INNER) JOIN', to see how it works</p>

    <h3>INNER JOIN</h3>
<pre><code>
    SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_date 
    FROM Orders
    INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id=customers.customer_id;
</code></pre>

<p>To make it more readable let's read it like this:</p>
<p>The first line is</p>
<pre><code>
    SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_date 
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, what we are doing is the following: <br><br>
"We are selecting the columns that we are going to return from this query, it means,<br>
that the result from our query wil have those columns" <br> In that case we just selected the columns: <br><br>
'order_id from the table orders', <br>
'customer_name from the table customers' and <br>
'order_date from the table orders'
</p>

<pre><code>
    FROM orders
</code></pre>

<p>For the last sentence, what we are doing there, is just specifying from WHICH table are we going to get the values for the columns <br>
that we selected <br><br> But as we can see we are only selecting one table, right? Thats not going to work because we specified that we wanted <br>
to use the column 'customer_name' from the table customers, so it supposed to be two tables. <br> <br>

So, the solution for that is just adding the following:
</p>
<pre><code>
    INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id=customers.customer_id;
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>INNER JOIN customers</code> we set the other table from where we are getting the data for the customer's column mentioned and <br> 
as we already said, the <code>INNER JOIN</code> statements return entries/records from both table but only where they match a specify case, so <br>
to specify that case we used the following: <br> <code>ON orders.customer_id=customers.customer_id</code>
<br>
<br>
So, as a whole, what we are doing is just the following: <br>
"We are selecting some columns from both tables, then, we say from where are we getting those columns, in this case is from orders and customers table, after that <br> 
we select a specific case that the result from our query must follow and that case is just 'please return the records/entries where they match this statement', that statement <br> 
is just return the records where the column customer_id in customers MATCH VALUES with the column customer_Id in orders" and then fill the columns that we select with those values
</p>

<h3>The result is going to be something like this:</h3>
<img src="../../assets/imgs/inner_join.png">

<h3>LEFT JOIN</h3>
<p>
    Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
</p>
<pre><code>
    SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_id
    FROM customers
    LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id=orders.customer_id;
</code></pre>

<p>
    Comparing this statement with the above statement, we see that the only <br>
    difference is the 'LEFT' keyword, in this case we're specifying the we will use <br>
    the LEFT JOIN query <br> <br>
    
    Here we've the result from the recent query:
</p>

<h3>RIGHT JOIN</h3>
<p>
Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
</p>
<pre><code>
   SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_id
   FROM customers
   RIGHT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id=orders.customer_id;
</code></pre>

<p>
Literally the same as the LEFT JOIN but replacing the keyword 'LEFT' for 'RIGHT' <br> <br>
Here we have the result:    
</p>

<h3>FULL JOIN(or FULL OUTER JOIN, is the same)</h3>
<p>For this statement we only need one match for it to return all records</p>
<pre>
    <code>
    SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_id
    FROM customers
    FULL JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id=orders.customer_id;
    </code>
</pre>

<p>**We were using mysql for testing the queries, in this case is not possible because MYSQL does not fully support <br>
the FULL JOIN statement.</p>

<h2>How to use the SQL UNION?</h2>

<p>The UNION keyword is used to combine two or more SELECT queries</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every <code>SELECT</code> statement within
  <code>UNION</code> must have the same number 
of columns</li>
  <li>The columns must also have similar data types</li>
  <li>The columns in 
  every <code>SELECT</code> statement must also be in the same order</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we have an example:</p>
<pre><code>
    SELECT id_registro , asiento, 'activos' AS 'origen'
    FROM activos
    UNION
    SELECT id_registro, asiento, 'observaciones' AS 'origen' FROM observaciones;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case we were using the database SGICA for testing this whole statement, as we can see <br>
the two table combine with eachother so we don't have 6 columns, we only have 3, but these 3 columns will fill <br>
its values with the values from these two tables, so there we have the combination.
