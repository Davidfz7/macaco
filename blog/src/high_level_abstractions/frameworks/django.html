    <h1>Concepts</h1>
    <h2>Stateful vs Stateless</h2>
    <h3>Stateful</h3>
    <p>An Stateful process allow clients/users to store, record, and return to <br>
        already established information and processes over the internet
    </p>
        <h4>So, In stateful process, what the client/user can do with it?</h4>
        <img src="../../../assets/imgs/statul_what_it_can_do.png" alt="" width="400px" height="400px">
        <h4>But, whats the process actually storing or recording? **(there might be actions, preferences, etc...)</h4>
        <img src="../../../assets/imgs/user_actions_stateful.png" alt="" width="1000px" height="400px">
        <h4>In a stateful process, what whill happend if the user/client "lost connection"</h4> 
        <img src="../../../assets/imgs/what_will_happen.png" alt="" width="1000px" height="400px">
        <p>First, as we can see in the previous image, all user/client information is stored in the process
            <br>
            <strong>So, what will happen when the client/user reconnects to that process?</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            So in that case, whenever the user tries to reconnect to the process and try to get information <br>
            about where he left off, the process will retrieve that information from its database, or txt file <br>
            or whatever it is using for storing data, then it'll send it back to the client, so the client <br>
            will be where he left off
        </p>

        <h3>Stateless</h3>
    <p>A stateless process does not retain information about 
    the user's previous interactions.
