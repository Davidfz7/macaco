    <h1>How do it know<br>What i learned</h1>
    <h4>From page 26 to 48</h4>
    <p> *The only thing a computer can 'remember'
    is wheter a bit was on or off</p>
    <h4>The following digram shows one bit of a computer memory</h4>
    <img src="../../assets/imgs/diagram1.png">
    <h4>And, how it works?</h4>
    <br>
    <strong>For choosing what bit to 'remember', we need to use the input 'i' from the
        recent diagram <br>Like this:<br></strong>
    <img src="../../assets/imgs/output_bit_one.png">
    <p>In this case we have a single memory bit, in here we use the light bulb as the reference for what 
        value the bit has, in this case is '1' because the light bulb it's on.
    </p>
    <strong>For a 0 bit, it will look something like this:<br></strong>
    <img src="../../assets/imgs/output_bit_zero.png">
    <p>Even though the input 's' is on, the output will be '0', as i said, the input that really matters 
    to choose what bit to 'remember' is the input 'i'.<br> 
    <strong>So, is there a reason for the 's' input?<br>Yes there is</strong>
